# Machine Learning Basics Nanodegree - Udacity
The goal of the Machine Learning Basics Nanodegree from Udacity is to learn techniques such as data transformation and algorithms that can find patterns in data and apply machine learning algorithms to tasks of their own design. Learning outcomes of this Nanodegree are as follows:
- Use Python and SQL to access and analysze data from several different data sources.
- Build predictive models using a variety of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.
- Perform feature engineering to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- Optimize, tune, and improve algorithms according to specific metrics like accuracy and speed.
- Compare the performaces of learned models using suitable metrics.

This is the repository of my exercises and projects for Machine Learning Basics Nanodegree from Udacity.

### Project 1: Find Donors for CharityML
CharityML is a fictious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Vallet. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity.
**Project Goal:**  is to evaluate and optimize several supervised learning algorithms to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while under some marketing constraints.
**Key Skills:** will include supervised learning, model evaluation and comparison, and tuning models according to constraints.

## Course 2: Deep Learning

- Lesson 1: Introduction to Neural Networks
- Lesson 2: Implementing Gradient Descent
- Lesson 3: Training Neural Networks
- Lesson 4: Deep Learning with PyTorch

### Project 2: Build an Image Classifier
Implement an image classifier application using deep neural network. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images.
**Ket Skills:** include PyTorch and neural networks, and model validation and evaluation.

## Course 3: Unsupervised Learning
- Lesson 1: Clustering
- Lesson 2: Hierarchicaal and Density-Based Clustering
- Lesson 3: Gaussian Mixture Models
- Lesson 4: Dimensionality Reduction
### Project 3: Create Customer Segments
In this project, you will apply unsepervised learning techologies on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbo, Portugal to identigy customer segments hidden in the data. You will first explore and pre-process the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the cleaned customer spending data, you will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, you will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways in which this information could assist the wholesale distributor with furure service changes.
**Key Skills:** include data cleaning, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and unsupervised clustering.
