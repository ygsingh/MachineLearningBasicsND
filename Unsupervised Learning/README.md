# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Exercises
- Clustering
- Hierarchical and Density-Based Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- Dimensionality Reduction


## Project: Create Customer Segments
This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many unsupervised learning algorithms available in sklearn. The objective is to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
Things you will learn by completing this project:

- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to perform feature transformation/scaling and PCA  dimensionality reduction decisions.
- How to apply clustering techniques. How to make decisions on how many clusters to use?
