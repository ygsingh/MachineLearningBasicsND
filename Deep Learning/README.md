## Project 2: Build an Image Classifier
In this project, you'll be implementing an image classification application. This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images, then use the trained model to classify images. First, you'll develop your code in a Jupyter notebook to make sure your taining implementation works. Then, you'll convert the code to a Python applicaiton that runs the command line.
